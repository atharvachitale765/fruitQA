# Apple Quality Detection Using YOLOv5 and PyTorch

This project focuses on classifying apple images into categories such as "Good", "Bad", and "Rotten" using YOLOv5 for object detection and a custom CNN for binary classification. This project was inspired by various research papers and documents that helped shape the methods and approaches used in the development.
